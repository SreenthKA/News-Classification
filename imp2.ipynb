      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Supermarket Without Bees: What Would The Produce Section Look Like Without Pollinators (PHOTOS) Have apples, carrots, lemons or watermelon on your grocery list? Bad news -- without bees, these foods could be much harder to find in the produce section, according to a new campaign from Whole Foods Market. Bees are still having a rough time. The British Beekeepers Association said more than a third of colonies died in England this past winter, and U.S. populations suffered similar drops. Researchers have said an industry practice of feeding bees corn syrup may spur colony collapse disorder, which could affect the $30 billion crop industry dependent on bee pollination. Europe instituted a temporary ban on a class of pesticides believed to be harmful to bees in April, and researchers at Washington State University have proposed a bee sperm bank to try and breed hardier colonies, but the insects are still dying in record numbers. So what would a supermarket without bees look like? Whole Foods pulled all of the produce dependent on pollinators from the shelves of their University Heights store in Rhode Island -- a whopping 237 items, or 52 percent of the normal product mix.

      "  Raw Input: Why Air Travel Still Sucks What if I told you we haven’t seen a genuine innovation to commercial flight in over 60 years? The Boeing 707 of the 1950s, often revered as the hallmark of commercial aeronautics, was just as fast as today’s planes. Sure, now you have six more inches of legroom and your peanuts are honey-roasted instead of salted, but the sad truth is that staid politics and the economy of flight have made it nearly impossible to traverse our skies any faster. The tech is there, but there’s a lot of problems getting in the way.  Air travel was once the giddy fancy of the world – we admired it as a fashionable, enviable experience to behold for yourself, and it’s since devolved into a stagnated industry ignorant of change. Not to mention a slew of tawdry airline incidents being brought to the public attention over the last few months. I’m looking at you, United. But today, I want to reveal why air travel still sucks, our fleeting attempt to revolutionize it, and where we can go from here. Commercial flight is something we’ve all come to take for granted, regardless of whether you’ve been on a plane or not. It’s incredibly safe, reasonably cost-effective, and much faster than any alternative form of travel. It has single-handedly revolutionized transportation, logistics, warfare, and economics. It’s continued to rule our lives, but the depressing part is that it hasn’t gotten better, at least not in a way we embraced.  In the early 1970s, the British and French got together and slapped a turbojet on a lean, fighter-jet-looking airliner and called it Concorde. With a top speed of 1,300 mph, the Concorde operated at Mach 2 and could cruise across the Atlantic in under four hours. It was the sexiest addition to commercial flight, and we had it totally under control. 27 years of operation, dozens of records broken, and a design that drew any headline possible. All of this seems spectacular, so why doesn’t every airline run a fleet of sky-streaking Concordes?  Surprise, surprise, the Concorde was prohibitively expensive and loud. Tickets prices were near robbery, and the airliner burned more fuel on its way from the terminal to the runway than an A320 did on a flight to Paris. Also, the sonic boom that it created was so deafening that several governments banned the Concorde from flying across overland routes. Couple this with limited capacity, even less demand, and egregious servicing costs, and we see how such a miracle technology was dealt the boot after only 2 decades of operation. What was once a complete revolution to air travel wilted into nothing more than a fancy exhibit at museums across the world. Some may say that no one really needs a supersonic aircraft – if the shoe fits, wear it. But truthfully, that isn’t the point. An ideal infrastructure for any nation is one where the best technology pervades an industry and forces everyone to tag along, but that is almost never the case. The fundamental laws of economics forbid it, and the often stringent dependencies formed by politics, competition, and commerce make it even more of a prohibitive desire. While incredibly hard to do, it isn’t impossible. Take a look at the iPhone – they brought the best possible technology to market and engendered a decade of catch up by previous titans in the industry.  On that note, companies exist who are once again trying to revolutionize commercial air travel. Companies like Boom promise to bring the once awe-inspiring technology back into the limelight, and it seems relatively promising, with airliners having requested 76 of their XB-1 Supersonic model. They champion faster, safer, and quieter supersonic flight, and while incredibly inspiring, the reality is that they haven’t released much other than computer generated renditions in a video. That’s not to say, however, that progress isn’t being made. Enterprises have begun to consider flipping the aeronautics industry on its head, and it’s only a matter of time until commercial flight becomes a direct beneficiary.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Supermarket Without Bees: What Would The Produce Section Look Like Without Pollinators (PHOTOS) Have apples, carrots, lemons or watermelon on your grocery list? Bad news -- without bees, these foods could be much harder to find in the produce section, according to a new campaign from Whole Foods Market. Bees are still having a rough time. The British Beekeepers Association said more than a third of colonies died in England this past winter, and U.S. populations suffered similar drops. Researchers have said an industry practice of feeding bees corn syrup may spur colony collapse disorder, which could affect the $30 billion crop industry dependent on bee pollination. Europe instituted a temporary ban on a class of pesticides believed to be harmful to bees in April, and researchers at Washington State University have proposed a bee sperm bank to try and breed hardier colonies, but the insects are still dying in record numbers. So what would a supermarket without bees look like? Whole Foods pulled all of the produce dependent on pollinators from the shelves of their University Heights store in Rhode Island -- a whopping 237 items, or 52 percent of the normal product mix.

      "  Raw Input: Why Air Travel Still Sucks What if I told you we haven’t seen a genuine innovation to commercial flight in over 60 years? The Boeing 707 of the 1950s, often revered as the hallmark of commercial aeronautics, was just as fast as today’s planes. Sure, now you have six more inches of legroom and your peanuts are honey-roasted instead of salted, but the sad truth is that staid politics and the economy of flight have made it nearly impossible to traverse our skies any faster. The tech is there, but there’s a lot of problems getting in the way.  Air travel was once the giddy fancy of the world – we admired it as a fashionable, enviable experience to behold for yourself, and it’s since devolved into a stagnated industry ignorant of change. Not to mention a slew of tawdry airline incidents being brought to the public attention over the last few months. I’m looking at you, United. But today, I want to reveal why air travel still sucks, our fleeting attempt to revolutionize it, and where we can go from here. Commercial flight is something we’ve all come to take for granted, regardless of whether you’ve been on a plane or not. It’s incredibly safe, reasonably cost-effective, and much faster than any alternative form of travel. It has single-handedly revolutionized transportation, logistics, warfare, and economics. It’s continued to rule our lives, but the depressing part is that it hasn’t gotten better, at least not in a way we embraced.  In the early 1970s, the British and French got together and slapped a turbojet on a lean, fighter-jet-looking airliner and called it Concorde. With a top speed of 1,300 mph, the Concorde operated at Mach 2 and could cruise across the Atlantic in under four hours. It was the sexiest addition to commercial flight, and we had it totally under control. 27 years of operation, dozens of records broken, and a design that drew any headline possible. All of this seems spectacular, so why doesn’t every airline run a fleet of sky-streaking Concordes?  Surprise, surprise, the Concorde was prohibitively expensive and loud. Tickets prices were near robbery, and the airliner burned more fuel on its way from the terminal to the runway than an A320 did on a flight to Paris. Also, the sonic boom that it created was so deafening that several governments banned the Concorde from flying across overland routes. Couple this with limited capacity, even less demand, and egregious servicing costs, and we see how such a miracle technology was dealt the boot after only 2 decades of operation. What was once a complete revolution to air travel wilted into nothing more than a fancy exhibit at museums across the world. Some may say that no one really needs a supersonic aircraft – if the shoe fits, wear it. But truthfully, that isn’t the point. An ideal infrastructure for any nation is one where the best technology pervades an industry and forces everyone to tag along, but that is almost never the case. The fundamental laws of economics forbid it, and the often stringent dependencies formed by politics, competition, and commerce make it even more of a prohibitive desire. While incredibly hard to do, it isn’t impossible. Take a look at the iPhone – they brought the best possible technology to market and engendered a decade of catch up by previous titans in the industry.  On that note, companies exist who are once again trying to revolutionize commercial air travel. Companies like Boom promise to bring the once awe-inspiring technology back into the limelight, and it seems relatively promising, with airliners having requested 76 of their XB-1 Supersonic model. They champion faster, safer, and quieter supersonic flight, and while incredibly inspiring, the reality is that they haven’t released much other than computer generated renditions in a video. That’s not to say, however, that progress isn’t being made. Enterprises have begun to consider flipping the aeronautics industry on its head, and it’s only a matter of time until commercial flight becomes a direct beneficiary.\n",

I appreciate everyone's sincere feedback so far. I encourage you to please engage in this discussion. I am watching the Sam Mendes production right now and Amy is about to not get married! This song can make or break my critique. Did you know it's even faster than Guns and Ships from Hamilton? Jon said  \"Raul's Bobby was robbed of the Tony. I saw it in Cincinnati and on Broadway and it was just devastating. I've seen the tape of the original cast recording and the national tour that was one of the first in the library at Lincoln Center. I didn't like the Ken Cen version much; the book scenes worked but the musical choreography was weak. NPH and the recent cast were strong, but my favorite as a whole is Sam Mendes production starring Adrian Lester, whose .... fueled 2nd act opener blew me away. It's available in it's entirety on You Tube and a most interesting take.\" Debra weighed in \"I've only seen Raúl Esparza and Neil Patrick Harris as Bobby. Esparza's performance is heartbreakingly beautiful. I've never seen (or felt) a performance quite like it.\"\n",

I prefer the 20th Anniversary Concert Les Misérables with Norm Lewis:  I have already watched Raúl Eduardo Esparza as Bobby this week. For no real reason, I decided to switch it up and put on the Neil Patrick Harris version of Stephen Sondheim's Company. This NPH version has Stephen Colbert and Patti LuPone.

      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: The Global Search for Education: The Rich, the Poor and What the World's Millennials Think  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation (OECD), the gap between the rich and the poor keeps widening, with the richest 10% of the population earning 9.6 times the income of the poorest 10%.  Income inequality has been growing on average in OECD countries over the last 25 years.  Relative poverty is increasing.  Their research also concluded there is a wider gap in education in the most unequal countries, which leads to a less effective workforce. For young people in particular, the situation has gotten much worse. The Millennial Bloggers are based all over the world. They are innovators in entrepreneurship, journalism, education, entertainment, and academic scholarship. This month we ask them to share their perspectives on the rich, the poor and the growing gap.  \"No, your eyes are not deceiving you. That's right.

      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Supermarket Without Bees: What Would The Produce Section Look Like Without Pollinators (PHOTOS) Have apples, carrots, lemons or watermelon on your grocery list? Bad news -- without bees, these foods could be much harder to find in the produce section, according to a new campaign from Whole Foods Market. Bees are still having a rough time. The British Beekeepers Association said more than a third of colonies died in England this past winter, and U.S. populations suffered similar drops. Researchers have said an industry practice of feeding bees corn syrup may spur colony collapse disorder, which could affect the $30 billion crop industry dependent on bee pollination. Europe instituted a temporary ban on a class of pesticides believed to be harmful to bees in April, and researchers at Washington State University have proposed a bee sperm bank to try and breed hardier colonies, but the insects are still dying in record numbers. So what would a supermarket without bees look like? Whole Foods pulled all of the produce dependent on pollinators from the shelves of their University Heights store in Rhode Island -- a whopping 237 items, or 52 percent of the normal product mix.

      "  Raw Input: Why Air Travel Still Sucks What if I told you we haven’t seen a genuine innovation to commercial flight in over 60 years? The Boeing 707 of the 1950s, often revered as the hallmark of commercial aeronautics, was just as fast as today’s planes. Sure, now you have six more inches of legroom and your peanuts are honey-roasted instead of salted, but the sad truth is that staid politics and the economy of flight have made it nearly impossible to traverse our skies any faster. The tech is there, but there’s a lot of problems getting in the way.  Air travel was once the giddy fancy of the world – we admired it as a fashionable, enviable experience to behold for yourself, and it’s since devolved into a stagnated industry ignorant of change. Not to mention a slew of tawdry airline incidents being brought to the public attention over the last few months. I’m looking at you, United. But today, I want to reveal why air travel still sucks, our fleeting attempt to revolutionize it, and where we can go from here. Commercial flight is something we’ve all come to take for granted, regardless of whether you’ve been on a plane or not. It’s incredibly safe, reasonably cost-effective, and much faster than any alternative form of travel. It has single-handedly revolutionized transportation, logistics, warfare, and economics. It’s continued to rule our lives, but the depressing part is that it hasn’t gotten better, at least not in a way we embraced.  In the early 1970s, the British and French got together and slapped a turbojet on a lean, fighter-jet-looking airliner and called it Concorde. With a top speed of 1,300 mph, the Concorde operated at Mach 2 and could cruise across the Atlantic in under four hours. It was the sexiest addition to commercial flight, and we had it totally under control. 27 years of operation, dozens of records broken, and a design that drew any headline possible. All of this seems spectacular, so why doesn’t every airline run a fleet of sky-streaking Concordes?  Surprise, surprise, the Concorde was prohibitively expensive and loud. Tickets prices were near robbery, and the airliner burned more fuel on its way from the terminal to the runway than an A320 did on a flight to Paris. Also, the sonic boom that it created was so deafening that several governments banned the Concorde from flying across overland routes. Couple this with limited capacity, even less demand, and egregious servicing costs, and we see how such a miracle technology was dealt the boot after only 2 decades of operation. What was once a complete revolution to air travel wilted into nothing more than a fancy exhibit at museums across the world. Some may say that no one really needs a supersonic aircraft – if the shoe fits, wear it. But truthfully, that isn’t the point. An ideal infrastructure for any nation is one where the best technology pervades an industry and forces everyone to tag along, but that is almost never the case. The fundamental laws of economics forbid it, and the often stringent dependencies formed by politics, competition, and commerce make it even more of a prohibitive desire. While incredibly hard to do, it isn’t impossible. Take a look at the iPhone – they brought the best possible technology to market and engendered a decade of catch up by previous titans in the industry.  On that note, companies exist who are once again trying to revolutionize commercial air travel. Companies like Boom promise to bring the once awe-inspiring technology back into the limelight, and it seems relatively promising, with airliners having requested 76 of their XB-1 Supersonic model. They champion faster, safer, and quieter supersonic flight, and while incredibly inspiring, the reality is that they haven’t released much other than computer generated renditions in a video. That’s not to say, however, that progress isn’t being made. Enterprises have begun to consider flipping the aeronautics industry on its head, and it’s only a matter of time until commercial flight becomes a direct beneficiary.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Why Air Travel Still Sucks What if I told you we haven’t seen a genuine innovation to commercial flight in over 60 years? The Boeing 707 of the 1950s, often revered as the hallmark of commercial aeronautics, was just as fast as today’s planes. Sure, now you have six more inches of legroom and your peanuts are honey-roasted instead of salted, but the sad truth is that staid politics and the economy of flight have made it nearly impossible to traverse our skies any faster. The tech is there, but there’s a lot of problems getting in the way.  Air travel was once the giddy fancy of the world – we admired it as a fashionable, enviable experience to behold for yourself, and it’s since devolved into a stagnated industry ignorant of change. Not to mention a slew of tawdry airline incidents being brought to the public attention over the last few months. I’m looking at you, United. But today, I want to reveal why air travel still sucks, our fleeting attempt to revolutionize it, and where we can go from here. Commercial flight is something we’ve all come to take for granted, regardless of whether you’ve been on a plane or not. It’s incredibly safe, reasonably cost-effective, and much faster than any alternative form of travel. It has single-handedly revolutionized transportation, logistics, warfare, and economics. It’s continued to rule our lives, but the depressing part is that it hasn’t gotten better, at least not in a way we embraced.  In the early 1970s, the British and French got together and slapped a turbojet on a lean, fighter-jet-looking airliner and called it Concorde. With a top speed of 1,300 mph, the Concorde operated at Mach 2 and could cruise across the Atlantic in under four hours. It was the sexiest addition to commercial flight, and we had it totally under control. 27 years of operation, dozens of records broken, and a design that drew any headline possible. All of this seems spectacular, so why doesn’t every airline run a fleet of sky-streaking Concordes?  Surprise, surprise, the Concorde was prohibitively expensive and loud. Tickets prices were near robbery, and the airliner burned more fuel on its way from the terminal to the runway than an A320 did on a flight to Paris. Also, the sonic boom that it created was so deafening that several governments banned the Concorde from flying across overland routes. Couple this with limited capacity, even less demand, and egregious servicing costs, and we see how such a miracle technology was dealt the boot after only 2 decades of operation. What was once a complete revolution to air travel wilted into nothing more than a fancy exhibit at museums across the world. Some may say that no one really needs a supersonic aircraft – if the shoe fits, wear it. But truthfully, that isn’t the point. An ideal infrastructure for any nation is one where the best technology pervades an industry and forces everyone to tag along, but that is almost never the case. The fundamental laws of economics forbid it, and the often stringent dependencies formed by politics, competition, and commerce make it even more of a prohibitive desire. While incredibly hard to do, it isn’t impossible. Take a look at the iPhone – they brought the best possible technology to market and engendered a decade of catch up by previous titans in the industry.  On that note, companies exist who are once again trying to revolutionize commercial air travel. Companies like Boom promise to bring the once awe-inspiring technology back into the limelight, and it seems relatively promising, with airliners having requested 76 of their XB-1 Supersonic model. They champion faster, safer, and quieter supersonic flight, and while incredibly inspiring, the reality is that they haven’t released much other than computer generated renditions in a video. That’s not to say, however, that progress isn’t being made. Enterprises have begun to consider flipping the aeronautics industry on its head, and it’s only a matter of time until commercial flight becomes a direct beneficiary.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Supermarket Without Bees: What Would The Produce Section Look Like Without Pollinators (PHOTOS) Have apples, carrots, lemons or watermelon on your grocery list? Bad news -- without bees, these foods could be much harder to find in the produce section, according to a new campaign from Whole Foods Market. Bees are still having a rough time. The British Beekeepers Association said more than a third of colonies died in England this past winter, and U.S. populations suffered similar drops. Researchers have said an industry practice of feeding bees corn syrup may spur colony collapse disorder, which could affect the $30 billion crop industry dependent on bee pollination. Europe instituted a temporary ban on a class of pesticides believed to be harmful to bees in April, and researchers at Washington State University have proposed a bee sperm bank to try and breed hardier colonies, but the insects are still dying in record numbers. So what would a supermarket without bees look like? Whole Foods pulled all of the produce dependent on pollinators from the shelves of their University Heights store in Rhode Island -- a whopping 237 items, or 52 percent of the normal product mix. Take a peek below. (h/t Grist)\n",

They’re meeting in the last place we saw the increasingly beleaguered Tony Soprano — Jersey’s Holsten’s restaurant — and listening to the same song: Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Cohen, sounding like a mobster, tells Trump:  “They say I might do 20 years unless I give you up.” Trump responds: “I’ve heard jail’s fun. It’s like camp — plus, there’s a free gym. Dude, you’re gonna get so jacked!” Giuliani laughs that Cohen can actually get a “real” law degree in prison. Then Donald Jr. (Mikey Day) saunters in as brother Eric (Alex Moffatt) tries in vain to parallel park his Big Wheels outside (again, a spoof of the “The Sopranos’” finale).

      "  Raw Input: A Hymn-Prayer For The Election The November 14 cover of The New Yorker magazine shows a newspaper being held by a subway commuter with the large headline, “OH, SWEET JESUS, PLEASE GOD, NO.”  The presidential election has inspired prayer even on the cover of magazines. In 2004, Carolyn Winfrey Gillette wrote a hymn-prayer (”In Times of Great Decision”) based on the “Principles for an Election Year” of the National Council of Churches that was used by so many congregations that it got quoted in newspapers and magazines.  While a number of churches are planning to use this hymn again in 2016, Carolyn has been pondering a new hymn for 2016.   She finished the new hymn yesterday and it is being shared online (Carolyn has given permission for local faith groups to use it for free).   The ecumenical Christian Churches Together and the national Presbyterian Outlook magazine posted PDFs of the hymn with music and as a worship bulletin insert for easy use.  God of All Peoples, Cultures and Nations  BUNESSAN 5.5.5.4 D   (“Morning Has Broken”) 1. God of all peoples, cultures and nations, God of the poor and wealthy ones, too-- Be with our land as we make decisions; Help us, we pray, to listen to you. 2. May we hear well your call to do justice; May we know all your children have worth. May we seek leaders who will end violence; May we choose ones who care for your earth. 3. May we be thoughtful in our decisions: Who will be truthful, moral and wise? Who will restore the streets that we live in? Who will love those whom others despise? 4. How will the ones campaigning to lead us Care for the stranger, outcast and poor? Will they hear ones who long have been silenced? Or will they say that wealth matters more? 5. God, may this time of anger be over; May we grow past our current divide. Make us as one, as sisters and brothers; In this good land, may your love abide.

      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Alec Baldwin's Trump Faces Ominous 'Sopranos' Scenario In 'SNL' Finale Things weren’t looking so sunny for Alec Baldwin’s Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live’s” cold open that channeled the last dark episode of HBO’s “The Sopranos.”  Baldwin kind of enjoys a get-together with sort-of pals and lawyers Michael Cohen, (Ben Stiller), and Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon) in the season finale. They’re meeting in the last place we saw the increasingly beleaguered Tony Soprano — Jersey’s Holsten’s restaurant — and listening to the same song: Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Cohen, sounding like a mobster, tells Trump:  “They say I might do 20 years unless I give you up.” Trump responds: “I’ve heard jail’s fun. It’s like camp — plus, there’s a free gym. Dude, you’re gonna get so jacked!” Giuliani laughs that Cohen can actually get a “real” law degree in prison. Then Donald Jr. (Mikey Day) saunters in as brother Eric (Alex Moffatt) tries in vain to parallel park his Big Wheels outside (again, a spoof of the “The Sopranos’” finale). In walks Robert Mueller, played by Robert De Niro. He sits, ominously, at a nearby table and only Trump can see him. As Mueller heads to the restroom, he points at his eyes, then at Trump, silently warning him: “I’m watching you.” Cut to black. Check it out above.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Hymn-Prayer For The Election The November 14 cover of The New Yorker magazine shows a newspaper being held by a subway commuter with the large headline, “OH, SWEET JESUS, PLEASE GOD, NO.”  The presidential election has inspired prayer even on the cover of magazines. In 2004, Carolyn Winfrey Gillette wrote a hymn-prayer (”In Times of Great Decision”) based on the “Principles for an Election Year” of the National Council of Churches that was used by so many congregations that it got quoted in newspapers and magazines.  While a number of churches are planning to use this hymn again in 2016, Carolyn has been pondering a new hymn for 2016.   She finished the new hymn yesterday and it is being shared online (Carolyn has given permission for local faith groups to use it for free).   The ecumenical Christian Churches Together and the national Presbyterian Outlook magazine posted PDFs of the hymn with music and as a worship bulletin insert for easy use.  God of All Peoples, Cultures and Nations  BUNESSAN 5.5.5.4 D   (“Morning Has Broken”) 1. God of all peoples, cultures and nations, God of the poor and wealthy ones, too-- Be with our land as we make decisions; Help us, we pray, to listen to you. 2. May we hear well your call to do justice; May we know all your children have worth. May we seek leaders who will end violence; May we choose ones who care for your earth. 3. May we be thoughtful in our decisions: Who will be truthful, moral and wise? Who will restore the streets that we live in? Who will love those whom others despise? 4. How will the ones campaigning to lead us Care for the stranger, outcast and poor? Will they hear ones who long have been silenced? Or will they say that wealth matters more? 5. God, may this time of anger be over; May we grow past our current divide. Make us as one, as sisters and brothers; In this good land, may your love abide.

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Iowa Governor Signs Nation's Strictest Abortion Ban Into Law Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) on Friday signed a law that would effectively ban abortions at six weeks of pregnancy, the nation’s strictest abortion legislation to date, setting up a legal battle with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The Republican-controlled state legislature passed the legislation, known as the “fetal heartbeat” bill, earlier this week, part of a wave of GOP-backed abortion restrictions introduced at the state level in recent years. The law requires women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound, banning the procedure if a fetal heartbeat is detected — typically at about six weeks into a pregnancy. It includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Medical professionals say that the law is far too stringent, as some women do not even know they are pregnant at six weeks.  Earlier Friday, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU announced that they plan to sue Reynolds over the law’s constitutionality.  “I believe that all innocent life is precious and sacred,” Reynolds said at the Iowa State Capitol, where protesters could be heard during the bill signing. “If death is determined when a heart stops beating, then doesn’t a beating heart indicate life?” She acknowledged that the bill may not go into effect, pending a legal challenge. But Reynolds, who has described herself as staunchly pro-life, said: “I’m not going to back down from who I am or what I believe in.” Similar bans in other states have failed to take effect due to legal challenges. Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision, affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion until the third trimester, and the court later held that the right existed until fetal viability — typically at 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy. Republicans and anti-abortion activists see Iowa’s law as an opportunity to chip away at the landmark ruling, and potentially take the legal battle to the Supreme Court. “This bill will be the vehicle that will ultimately provide change and provide the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade,” state Sen. Rick Bertrand (R) said earlier this week. “There’s nothing hidden here about the agenda.” Several dozen states have either passed or considered abortion restrictions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies policies on reproductive rights. Some states have also aimed to ban specific methods for abortions. This story has been updated with comments from Reynolds. Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to include more details about the Supreme Court cases that affirmed a woman’s right to an abortion. \n",

In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Why Air Travel Still Sucks What if I told you we haven’t seen a genuine innovation to commercial flight in over 60 years? The Boeing 707 of the 1950s, often revered as the hallmark of commercial aeronautics, was just as fast as today’s planes. Sure, now you have six more inches of legroom and your peanuts are honey-roasted instead of salted, but the sad truth is that staid politics and the economy of flight have made it nearly impossible to traverse our skies any faster. The tech is there, but there’s a lot of problems getting in the way.  Air travel was once the giddy fancy of the world – we admired it as a fashionable, enviable experience to behold for yourself, and it’s since devolved into a stagnated industry ignorant of change. Not to mention a slew of tawdry airline incidents being brought to the public attention over the last few months. I’m looking at you, United. But today, I want to reveal why air travel still sucks, our fleeting attempt to revolutionize it, and where we can go from here. Commercial flight is something we’ve all come to take for granted, regardless of whether you’ve been on a plane or not. It’s incredibly safe, reasonably cost-effective, and much faster than any alternative form of travel. It has single-handedly revolutionized transportation, logistics, warfare, and economics. It’s continued to rule our lives, but the depressing part is that it hasn’t gotten better, at least not in a way we embraced.  In the early 1970s, the British and French got together and slapped a turbojet on a lean, fighter-jet-looking airliner and called it Concorde. With a top speed of 1,300 mph, the Concorde operated at Mach 2 and could cruise across the Atlantic in under four hours. It was the sexiest addition to commercial flight, and we had it totally under control. 27 years of operation, dozens of records broken, and a design that drew any headline possible. All of this seems spectacular, so why doesn’t every airline run a fleet of sky-streaking Concordes?  Surprise, surprise, the Concorde was prohibitively expensive and loud. Tickets prices were near robbery, and the airliner burned more fuel on its way from the terminal to the runway than an A320 did on a flight to Paris. Also, the sonic boom that it created was so deafening that several governments banned the Concorde from flying across overland routes. Couple this with limited capacity, even less demand, and egregious servicing costs, and we see how such a miracle technology was dealt the boot after only 2 decades of operation. What was once a complete revolution to air travel wilted into nothing more than a fancy exhibit at museums across the world. Some may say that no one really needs a supersonic aircraft – if the shoe fits, wear it. But truthfully, that isn’t the point. An ideal infrastructure for any nation is one where the best technology pervades an industry and forces everyone to tag along, but that is almost never the case. The fundamental laws of economics forbid it, and the often stringent dependencies formed by politics, competition, and commerce make it even more of a prohibitive desire. While incredibly hard to do, it isn’t impossible. Take a look at the iPhone – they brought the best possible technology to market and engendered a decade of catch up by previous titans in the industry.  On that note, companies exist who are once again trying to revolutionize commercial air travel. Companies like Boom promise to bring the once awe-inspiring technology back into the limelight, and it seems relatively promising, with airliners having requested 76 of their XB-1 Supersonic model. They champion faster, safer, and quieter supersonic flight, and while incredibly inspiring, the reality is that they haven’t released much other than computer generated renditions in a video. That’s not to say, however, that progress isn’t being made. Enterprises have begun to consider flipping the aeronautics industry on its head, and it’s only a matter of time until commercial flight becomes a direct beneficiary.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Asia Argento's Fiery Speech Closes Cannes: ‘I Was Raped By Harvey Weinstein Here’ There were a few moments of protest for equal rights at the Cannes Film Festival this year, but none quite as fierce as the surprise speech actress Asia Argento gave at the festival’s closing ceremony on Saturday. Before presenting the award for best actress, Argento said she had something to say. She called Cannes Harvey Weinstein’s “hunting ground,” and said he raped her at the festival in 1997 when she was 21 years old. Festival organizers reportedly had no idea she was going to make any remarks. “I want to make a prediction,” she added. “Harvey Weinstein will never be welcomed here ever again. He will live in disgrace shunned by a film community that once embraced him and covered up for his crimes.” She went on to call out predators she said still work in the film industry and issued a warning. “And even tonight sitting among you there are those who still have to be held accountable for their conduct against women. For behavior that does not belong in this industry ― does not belong in any industry or workplace. You know who you are. But most importantly, we know who you are, and we’re not going to allow you to get away with it any longer,” she said. In an impassioned speech at the #CannesFilmFestival, Asia Argento warned members of the audience 'we know who you are' over the abuse of actresses pic.twitter.com/fwok7jO9FK According to The Hollywood Reporter, Argento entered to roaring applause but the audience looked visibly stunned as she made her remarks about Weinstein and Cannes. Argento is one of several women who have previously accused Weinstein of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. She was one of the earliest to speak out and share her story in Ronan Farrow’s Pulitzer Prize-winning piece in The New Yorker last year on the widespread allegations of Weinstein’s predatory behavior. Argento shared her remarks on Twitter with a message for sexual assault survivors. “For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power,” she wrote. This is the speech I wrote and spoke out loud tonight at Cannes. For all the brave women who came forward denouncing their predators, and for all the brave women who will come forward in the future. We got the power #metoo pic.twitter.com/ttJN1pNFxR Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Among criminal investigations into his behavior, Weinstein faces a lawsuit filed by Ashley Judd, who was also one of the first to speak out and allege sexual misconduct against the disgraced film producer. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from rape to sexual harassment.\n",

      "  Raw Input: A Glimmer Of Hope In Our Skills Gap Crisis When President Trump introduced us to the “Buy American, Hire American” executive order in April, his electoral base applauded the decision to stand up for American workers. The Administration’s order is a noble one in theory – focusing on hiring American workers to bolster our domestic economy by using American labor and products – but the order fails to acknowledge the gap between our domestic high-skilled workforce and the needs of the modern century economy. The president’s announcement missed the mark on addressing the genuine issues that our economy and workforce face. In fact, instead of cutting red tape as promised in the campaign, the White House is unfortunately imposing new restrictions on what companies can do and who they can hire. Furthermore, scholars and experts will argue how a tightening of immigration rules could lead to greater outsourcing of American labor and achieve the opposite goal of the president’s executive order. In an op-ed penned by Stuart Anderson, the executive director National Foundation for American Policy, Anderson explains that immigration actually opens up job opportunities for American workers and provides other avenues for employment in the United States. A simple economic reality check by this administration would support that point. While the President’s executive order might score some short-term political wins, both near-term and enduring solutions need to be presented to remedy our growing domestic educational gap, particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This deficit is real and forces American businesses today to use high-skilled foreign workers, be they in the U.S. on the H-1B visa, or overseas. The United States is rapidly falling behind other developed countries STEM fields. A recent Program for International Student Assessment study found that US students’ performance in math was 20 points below the OECD average, 24th out of the 33 countries surveyed in science, and barely above average in literacy. That is simply not acceptable. The reality is that our schools are not producing the 21st century workforce our companies need to remain competitive on the global stage. The number of American students pursuing STEM careers is growing at less than one percent each year. That means by 2018 there will be over 200,000 STEM jobs that will go unfilled by American workers. This evidence shows the skills gap is very real. According to data collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be over 1.4 million software-development jobs in the US that will go unfilled by 2020. New figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also illustrate worrying evidence “of an expanding skills gap between what Americans can do and what corporate America needs done.” But the last two weeks may offer some hope. The White House has announced a series of actions designed to expand apprenticeships and job retraining for American workers. While details are light, the workforce initiative could provide in-demand skills training to millions of Americans via apprenticeships, an attractive option, particularly those that might forgo a traditional four-year degree. While Ivanka Trump will helm the initiative, I was encouraged to see a role for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who President Trump has said is “working to ensure that our workers are trained for the skilled technical jobs that will – in the future – power our country.” The mission of the Department of Education is to “promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness,” and that is exactly the kind of leadership and policies this administration needs to promote. Advocating for smart, up-to-date education policies would be a great way to keep American workers competitive in the global market. Unfortunately, the President missed an opportunity in his executive order to lead a conversation around meaningful reforms. I know just how important it is to champion smart and modern educational policies. When I served as the governor of New Mexico, I shifted the necessary resources – over $1 billion invested in New Mexico’s public schools – towards early education in the classroom and increased access for childhood education. Directing funding and resources towards education – especially education that reinforces STEM skills at early levels – is the shift this administration needs to make to help keep American workers competitive in today’s economy. Directing resources on the national scale toward programs which encourage the elevation of STEM skills should have been the proposal made by the Trump administration in Wisconsin. Instead of disparaging foreign workers, this country should embrace their contributions and recognize their importance in helping the country address a rapidly growing STEM gap. It’s time to have a conversation about modernized policies that keep Americans competitive on the global stage. The “Buy American, Hire American” executive order was a flawed attempt at addressing our growing need for H-1B visa holders. While we must look to solve abuses in the system and ensure visas are given to the best and brightest workers, we must also be aware that major structural changes are needed on education. By including the Department of Education in conversations on the President’s workforce initiatives, perhaps this administration can be a leader in addressing America’s STEM gap. Bill Richardson is the former governor of New Mexico and current co-chair of the American Competitiveness Alliance, an organization dedicated to advancing the United States’ economic competitiveness in the global market.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Dear Medical Science: What's Taking You So Long? When I was a little kid, I had a lot of faith in you guys. Maybe I watched too many Star Trek episodes, but I figured by now -- 50 years later -- you'd have invented some miracle laser-like gizmo that could cure everything. The patient would lie down on a diagnostic bio-bed. Then the doctor would wave the gizmo over the illness-ridden body and -- presto! -- the affliction would magically vanish.  Where's the gizmo, guys? We want the gizmo. Okay, forget the gizmo. I'll settle for a Miracle Pill that does the same thing.  For decades we've been throwing money at you and, I hate to say it, I was kind of hoping for something more by now. Okay, I'm an impatient patient. Sue me.  That's not to say you haven't made some amazing advances. You've given us meds for cholesterol, ED, depression, AIDS, blood pressure and a host of other ailments; there are bionic hands, heart transplants, new vaccines, nerve regrowth, facial reconstruction, MRIs, laparoscopy and a whole lot more.  But, to cite a few examples, you still can't cure Alzheimer's; cancer, in all it's many delightful forms, still mystifies you; you haven't put the kibosh on multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, diabetes or heart disease; hell, you haven't even rid the planet of hemorrhoids yet.  Guys, we don't want to go through all that suffering anymore. We're sick of getting sick. It's the 21st Century. Stem cells were discovered in 1978. You promised us limitless possibilities, yet here we are, 36 years later, still twiddling our thumbs.  Here's how primitive we still are: Kidney patients still have to be hooked up to washing machines; basal cell carcinomas still have to be dug out by hand; skulls still have to be drilled to get to brain tumors; casts are still used for broken limbs; we still repair wounds with thread or staples; tooth extractions still require a set of pliers; amputations still involve saws; hoses explore our digestive systems; we still use catheters (the last major improvement was the flexible catheter, invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752, hello.)  Let's take cancer. If you are unlucky enough to get pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, you can pretty much put a down payment on a tombstone. After decades of research, here's what we have in the arsenal: surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Not very impressive guys. Surgery is still horrible no matter how you... um... cut it; radiation is... well... radiation. Then there's the wonder of chemotherapy (invented in the 1940s.) Good job there, fellas. Poison the victim and hope that the cancer succumbs and the patient survives. What a breakthrough. Remember the old medical practice of bleeding patients to cure them of just about everything? Today, we ridicule that boneheaded procedure as hopelessly medieval. Ha ha. Guess what? A hundred years from now, scientists will get a huge guffaw out of chemo.  Where are the Pasteurs, Flemings and Salks of yesteryear? If it had taken the estimable Dr. Salk as long as it takes you, half the world's population would still think the iron lung is a marvel of ingenuity.  Here's what really bothers me: Everyday we read about your latest earthshattering breakthroughs. \"Scientists Build Liver Out of Stem Cells!\" \"Scientists Solve Mystery of Aging!\" \"Researchers Discover New Drug that Shrinks Tumors!\"  Wow, I say excitedly. Finally.  Then what happens? Nothing. It seems as if none of these exciting new medical miracles ever make it from the lab to the hospital. They just seem to... disappear. We never hear about them again. What happened? Was it all just optimism? Is there a need to publish something to justify the investment? Is the FDA dragging its feet? Is Big Pharma quashing them? Are the rats faking it? What?  All I know is that my internist did not offer me a new liver the last time I saw him, not that I need one. Yet.\n",

      "  Raw Input: Twitter CEO Defends Decision To Permanently Ban Notorious Twitter Troll When does free speech become hate speech? That can be a tricky question to answer, but, as the late Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said (of pornography), “I know it when I see it.” And so, for that matter, does Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, who is defending his company’s decision to permanently ban Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor at the conservative website Breitbart. The problem, however, is that there are plenty of trolls who don’t get banned ― and the company knows it. “We don’t ban people for expressing their thoughts,” Dorsey, who uses the handle @Jack, tweeted Thursday in response to accusations of “cyber feudalism” by WikiLeaks. “Targeted abuse & inciting abuse against people however, that’s not allowed.” Cyber feudalism: @Twitter founder @Jack banned conservative gay libertarian @nero for speaking the 'wrong' way to actress @Lesdoggg @wikileaks we don't ban people for expressing their thoughts. Targeted abuse & inciting abuse against people however, that's not allowed Instagram followed Twitter’s lead Thursday and also banned Yiannopoulos. Yiannopoulos (who formerly used the Twitter handle @nero) was banned Tuesday for orchestrating a widespread, pernicious attack against Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones on Monday, in which his more than 300,000 followers flooded her account with racist, abusive and sexually explicit messages. At first, Jones, who is black, flagged and reported offending tweets like this one: I just don't understand pic.twitter.com/N9xWoXPttu Unable to keep up with the attacks, she ultimately opted to sign off, remarking, “These people hate themselves.” “I feel like I’m in a personal hell,” she tweeted before she left the network. “I didn’t do anything to deserve this. It’s just too much. It shouldn’t be like this. So hurt right now.” “I leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart,” she also wrote. “All this cause I did a movie.” Monday’s assault was only the latest in a long string of abusive Yiannopoulos tirades, for which he’d been warned by Twitter in the past. Twitter stood by its decision to permanently ban Yiannopoulos in a statement to Recode Tuesday: People should be able to express diverse opinions and beliefs on Twitter. But no one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others. Over the past 48 hours in particular, we’ve seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of Tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension. We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter. We agree. We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it’s happening and prevent repeat offenders. We have been in the process of reviewing our hateful conduct policy to prohibit additional types of abusive behavior and allow more types of reporting, with the goal of reducing the burden on the person being targeted. We’ll provide more details on those changes in the coming weeks. It seems WikiLeaks didn’t necessarily disagree with Yiannopoulos’ ban from Twitter, but more took issue with the lack of transparency around how the decision to ban him was reached. The group pressed on that in followup tweets Thursday: “Who has access to justice?” the group wrote in one post. “Many have had vastly worse. What’s the appeal mechanism? What’s the transparency of the process?” “Because it appears that a politically aligned famous American actress has access to ban-power that everyone else does not,” Wikileaks also tweeted. And, as HuffPost’s Damon Beres wrote this week, “banning one person ― even one as high-profile as Yiannopoulos ― likely won’t protect others from abuse on a platform that makes it effortless for anyone to join on an anonymous basis.”\n",

      "  Raw Input: Why Air Travel Still Sucks What if I told you we haven’t seen a genuine innovation to commercial flight in over 60 years? The Boeing 707 of the 1950s, often revered as the hallmark of commercial aeronautics, was just as fast as today’s planes. Sure, now you have six more inches of legroom and your peanuts are honey-roasted instead of salted, but the sad truth is that staid politics and the economy of flight have made it nearly impossible to traverse our skies any faster. The tech is there, but there’s a lot of problems getting in the way.  Air travel was once the giddy fancy of the world – we admired it as a fashionable, enviable experience to behold for yourself, and it’s since devolved into a stagnated industry ignorant of change. Not to mention a slew of tawdry airline incidents being brought to the public attention over the last few months. I’m looking at you, United. But today, I want to reveal why air travel still sucks, our fleeting attempt to revolutionize it, and where we can go from here. Commercial flight is something we’ve all come to take for granted, regardless of whether you’ve been on a plane or not. It’s incredibly safe, reasonably cost-effective, and much faster than any alternative form of travel. It has single-handedly revolutionized transportation, logistics, warfare, and economics. It’s continued to rule our lives, but the depressing part is that it hasn’t gotten better, at least not in a way we embraced.  In the early 1970s, the British and French got together and slapped a turbojet on a lean, fighter-jet-looking airliner and called it Concorde. With a top speed of 1,300 mph, the Concorde operated at Mach 2 and could cruise across the Atlantic in under four hours. It was the sexiest addition to commercial flight, and we had it totally under control. 27 years of operation, dozens of records broken, and a design that drew any headline possible. All of this seems spectacular, so why doesn’t every airline run a fleet of sky-streaking Concordes?  Surprise, surprise, the Concorde was prohibitively expensive and loud. Tickets prices were near robbery, and the airliner burned more fuel on its way from the terminal to the runway than an A320 did on a flight to Paris. Also, the sonic boom that it created was so deafening that several governments banned the Concorde from flying across overland routes. Couple this with limited capacity, even less demand, and egregious servicing costs, and we see how such a miracle technology was dealt the boot after only 2 decades of operation. What was once a complete revolution to air travel wilted into nothing more than a fancy exhibit at museums across the world. Some may say that no one really needs a supersonic aircraft – if the shoe fits, wear it. But truthfully, that isn’t the point. An ideal infrastructure for any nation is one where the best technology pervades an industry and forces everyone to tag along, but that is almost never the case. The fundamental laws of economics forbid it, and the often stringent dependencies formed by politics, competition, and commerce make it even more of a prohibitive desire. While incredibly hard to do, it isn’t impossible. Take a look at the iPhone – they brought the best possible technology to market and engendered a decade of catch up by previous titans in the industry.  On that note, companies exist who are once again trying to revolutionize commercial air travel. Companies like Boom promise to bring the once awe-inspiring technology back into the limelight, and it seems relatively promising, with airliners having requested 76 of their XB-1 Supersonic model. They champion faster, safer, and quieter supersonic flight, and while incredibly inspiring, the reality is that they haven’t released much other than computer generated renditions in a video. That’s not to say, however, that progress isn’t being made. Enterprises have begun to consider flipping the aeronautics industry on its head, and it’s only a matter of time until commercial flight becomes a direct beneficiary.\n",
